        <header>
            <h1 style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>1-Application of Oil:</strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size: large;"> In our everyday life we often forget to the most simple and basic way that our hair would get the required nourishment and nutrients. Application of oil ensures that happens. Its application every alternate day is a must if your hair is dry or is brittle. The oil should be massaged on the scalp to get the optimum results. You can use any type of oil for example, coconut oil, almond oil, argan oil or even olive oil. These oils are suitable for any type of hair.  Use oil for atleast 3 days a week and witness the magic it creates on your hair quality.</p>

        <header>
            <h1 style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>2-Using Conditioner after Shampoo:</strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size: large;">The use of conditioner is almost a mandatory after you shampoo. This ensures that your hair doesn’t lose its properties and helps lock the nutrients inside the scalp. Often people forget the use because of the time it consumes but trust me; once you start using this the quality of your hair will increase drastically. You should wash your hair on the same day you used oil or on the day after. Keeping the oil of your scalp for lng time might result in dandruff producing or the accumulation of dust and dirt due to its sticky nature so better safe than sorry.</p>

        <header>
            <h1 style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>3-Proper drying of hair.</strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size: large;">Let me guess, after you wash your hair you just take the towel and rub like a maniac. That type of rubbing causes your hair to break and as a result you start going bald at some places. It’s because your hair is brittle and weak after a wash. But don’t worry here what you can do instead, once out of the bath take your towel and use the pat and move technique. You just have to pat gently and move, this technique ensures that your hair doesn’t break. Use this technique and see the change in your hair texture.</p>

        <header>
            <h1 style="font-weight: 200;"><strong>4-An important point!:</strong></h1>
            <p style="font-size: large;">You have to get your hands out hair! You style it and leave it, the constant disturbance actually makes the hair weak because your hands become sweaty and has dirt accumulated on it so when you rub your hair with it, the dirt gets deposited on the hair and weakens it. Also an important part of taking care of your health is that don’t go too long between your haircuts. If you’re doing so then fix it because it ruins the quality of your hair and damages with time.</p>
